# Using JupyterLab

This folder contains completed notebooks and other files used in the Real Python tutorial on [Using JupyterLab](https://realpython.com/using-jupyterlab/). 

None of the files are mandatory to complete the tutorial, howevre you may find them of use to continue your learning by experimenting more with them.

## Setup

The easiest way to incorporate these files into JupyterLab is to copy them into the folder from which you intend starting JupyterLab. They can then be accessed from its File Browser.
 
## Usage

After creating and activating your virtual environment, and installing the dependencies, you can load any file into JupyterLab by double-clicking on it.
