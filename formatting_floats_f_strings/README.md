These materials are for use with the RealPython tutorial [How to Format Floats Within F-Strings in Python](https://realpython.com/how-to-python-f-string-format-float/)

The code plus exercise solutions are all presented inside the Code_and_Solutions.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.

To view the file you will need to install either [Jupyter Notebook](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/) or [JupyterLab](https://realpython.com/using-jupyterlab/).

Note: Some minor differences exist between the code presented in the article and those in the Jupyter Notebook. This is necessary to align the output of the Notebook with those in the standard Python repl used to produce the article.

You should also run Python 3.12 or later.
