# Using JupyterLab

This folder contains completed notebooks and other files used in the Real Python tutorial on [using JupyterLab](https://realpython.com/using-jupyterlab/). 

None of the files are mandatory to complete the tutorial. However, you may find them of use to continue your learning by experimenting more with them.

## Setup

The easiest way to incorporate these files into JupyterLab is to copy them into their own `Samples/` folder as instructed in the tutorial. You can then access them from JupyterLab's _file browser_ when needed.
 
## Usage

After creating and activating your virtual environment, installing the dependencies, and starting the JupyterLab server, you can load any file by double-clicking on it from the _file browser_ in JupyterLab.
