# Practical Prompt Engineering

This repository contains a practical example to showcase a few common prompt engineering techniques. It's the code base used in the [associated Real Python tutorial on prompt engineering](https://realpython.com/practical-prompt-engineering/). The project allows you to preprocess customer service chats using GPT-3 and GPT-4 using the OpenAI API.

## Setup

Export your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

You can generate your [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) in your OpenAI account settings.

## Install

Create and activate a [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/). Then install the `openai` dependency:

```bash
(venv) $ python -m pip install openai
```

## Usage

Read support chat conversations from a file, sanitize the text, classify by sentiment, and format the output as JSON:

```bash
(venv) $ python app.py chats.txt
```

You can provide a different file as input file.

## Prompts

Change the prompts used in the script by editing the entries in `settings.toml`. The repository also contains a second settings file, `final-settings.toml`, which contains the prompts that you use in the final section.

While working through the tutorial, you'll learn how iteratively developing the prompt can give you better results based on a couple of prompting techniques. Here you'll find a collection of all the prompts you use throughout the tutorial:

### Zero-shot Prompting

```toml
instruction_prompt = """
Remove personally identifiable information, only show the date,
and replace all swear words with "ðŸ˜¤"
"""
```

### One-shot Prompting

```toml
instruction_prompt = """
Remove personally identifiable information, only show the date,
and replace all swear words with "ðŸ˜¤"

Example Input:
[support_tom] 2023-07-24T10:02:23+00:00 : What can I help you with?
[johndoe] 2023-07-24T10:03:15+00:00 : I CAN'T CONNECT TO MY BLASTED ACCOUNT
[support_tom] 2023-07-24T10:03:30+00:00 : Are you sure it's not your caps lock?
[johndoe] 2023-07-24T10:04:03+00:00 : Blast! You're right!

Example Output:
[Agent] 2023-07-24 : What can I help you with?
[Customer] 2023-07-24 : I CAN'T CONNECT TO MY ðŸ˜¤ ACCOUNT
[Agent] 2023-07-24 : Are you sure it's not your caps lock?
