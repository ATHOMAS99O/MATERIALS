# Downloadable Files

This folder contains completed notebooks and other files used in the Real Python tutorial on [Using Python for Data Analysis](https://realpython.com/using-python-for-data-analysis/). 

The `james_bond_data.csv` file contains the original uncleansed data and is the only mandatory file you will need to complete the tutorial. The same data is also available in JSON, Parquet and Excel versions to allow you to complete the optional exercises in reading from these file types.

A cleansed version of the original data is available in the `james_bond_data_cleansed.csv` file.
 
The complete code is available in the `Solution-New.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.

## Setup

The easiest way to work through this tutorial is to install and use [JupyterLab](https://realpython.com/using-jupyterlab/). Using Jupyter Notebook within JupyterLab will allow you to run code and see its results cleanly, and in the same way they are presented in the tutorial.  It will also make it easy for you to view the supporting files.
