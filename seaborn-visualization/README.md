# Visualizing Data In Python With seaborn

This folder contains completed notebooks and other files used in the Real Python tutorial on [Visualizing Data In Python With seaborn](https://realpython.com/creating-data-visualizations-in-python-seaborn/).

None of the files are mandatory to complete the tutorial, however you may find them of use to continue your learning by experimenting more with them.

## Available Files:

`RealPython_Article.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook containing all the code used in the tutorial, plus task solutions.
`data_analysis_results.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook containing the final version of the cleansing and analysis code.
`cereals_data.csv` contains the cereals data in CSV format.
`cycle_crossings_apr_jun.csv` contains the cycle crossings data in CSV format.
`tips.csv` is a local copy of the tips file available as a practice file from the seaborn developers.

## Although the tutorial can be completed in a range of Python environments, the use of Jupyter Notebook within JupyterLab is highly recommended.
